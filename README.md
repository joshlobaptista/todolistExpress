# todolistExpress

This project was made so individuals can add tasks to their list.

# How It's Made: 
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB, and Express.js

In this project, we wanted to create a space where people that work in groups come add and share tasks with another user. The users can add tasks, delete tasks, and update tasks that have been already added.

Optimizations Still need better styling.

# Lesson Learned:
Will come later when changes are made.
